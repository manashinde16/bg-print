# Cloud-Based Printing and Home Delivery

## Project Overview

The "Cloud-Based Printing and Home Delivery" project is a digital solution aimed at streamlining the process of printing documents via cloud services and delivering the printed materials to a customer's doorstep. This system caters to users who require the convenience of remote printing without the need for personal printers and offers the added benefit of home delivery.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Document Upload:** Users can upload documents to the cloud for printing. Supported formats include PDF, DOCX, and more.
- **Print Job Customization:** Users can select printing preferences such as paper size, color options, and the number of copies.
- **Order Placement:** After customizing the print job, users can place an order for printing and delivery.
- **Order Tracking:** Users can track the status of their print orders, from printing to delivery.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment gateway integration for easy and safe transactions.
- **Home Delivery:** The system arranges for the printed documents to be delivered to the user's specified address.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native (for mobile applications on iOS and Android).
- **Backend:** Python with Django (for server-side logic and API development).
- **Database:** MySQL (for storing user information, order details, and document metadata).
- **Cloud Storage:** Integration with AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing and retrieving documents.
- **Payment Gateway:** Integration with services like Stripe or PayPal for processing transactions.
- **Security:** Implementation of secure authentication mechanisms and encryption of sensitive data.

- **Backend:**
  - Python 3.x
  - Django
  - MySQL server
  
- **Cloud Storage:**
  - AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage account

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cloud-printing-home-delivery.git
   cd cloud-printing-home-delivery
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the React Native application:
     ```bash
     react-native run-android # For Android
     react-native run-ios     # For iOS
     ```

3. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Configure MySQL database settings in `settings.py`.
   - Run migrations and start the Django server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   CLOUD_STORAGE_KEY=your_cloud_storage_key
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_KEY=your_payment_gateway_key
   ```

5. **Access the Application:**
   - **Frontend:** Open the mobile application on your Android or iOS device.
   - **Backend:** The Django API will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
